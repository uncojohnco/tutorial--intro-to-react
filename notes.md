# Whatis react

- react 15 vs 16
- virtual dom libraries - lithtml, preact, virtualdom
- react view should only contain logic
- redux - state
- react - unidirectional

# ES6

- Can compile older ver for compatibility
- back ticks for multiple lines

```
`a

b`

'a b'
```

Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions.

- forEach returns None, map - returns an immutable value
  tells react to rerender!
